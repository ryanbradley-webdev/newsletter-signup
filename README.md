## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I'm continuing to learn how to adapt designs to varying screen sizes in an appropriate way. For this project I decided to base the breakpoints around the minimum width of the desktop form component and maintain a constant mobile-sized form for smaller screens. This way I kept the design consistent without having to invent new designs for mobile.

### Continued development

My method of form validation is continuing to evolve. As my technique improves, I'll apply it to older projects like this one.
